This program reads in a file called Schedule.txt in the current directory and outputs Schedule.tex.

This Schedule.tex file is a table that shows the stuff scheduled.


It's pretty raw, but that's because I just wrote it to be for me.
You can have it if you like.

Schedule.txt Syntax:
Name To Be Displayed;uniqueId;colour
	Mon,Tues;10:00-12:20

Where I don't think the uniqueId can have spaces or any weird characters.
I think internally it is used as a variable name...
Colour can be white black(with white text) red green blue cyan magenta yellow

Example Schedule.txt:
CS 246;cs;green
	Tues,Thurs;10:00-11:20
	Mon;11:30-12:20
STAT 230;stat;blue
	Mon,Wed,Fri;12:30-1:20
	Wed;3:30-4:20
