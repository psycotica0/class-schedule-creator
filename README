This program takes in a description of classes and their times and outputs a nice table.

It can output in tex format (For compiling into pdf) and html.

The script takes input from stdin, and outputs to stdout in html form by default.

The -f flag optionally specifies an input file.
The -o flag optionally specifies an output file.
The -t flag specifies the output format. It is html by default.

Input Syntax:
Name To Be Displayed;uniqueId;colour
	Mon,Tues;10:00-12:20

Where I don't think the uniqueId can have spaces or any weird characters.
I think internally it is used as a variable name...
Colour can be white black(with white text) red green blue cyan magenta yellow
